Gluten Tag!

Welcome to \textit{The Sourdough Framework Recipes}, a culinary compendium for
home bakers. This book is a sequel to \textit{The Sourdough Framework (TSF)} and builds upon
its knowledge. For this reason, it is recommended to read \textit{TSF} before following the recipes
shown in this book.

Herein, you will find a blend of my baking insights and recipes from me and our global
community. This collection showcases the rich diversity of bread making,
featuring recipes from various cultures. It's more than a recipe book; it's a
celebration of global flavors and techniques. The goal of this book is to provide
you with inspiration for your daily bread-making.

\textit{The Sourdough Framework Recipes} is a living testament to the communal
spirit of baking. I warmly invite you to contribute your recipes. This book
is an ongoing work and I hope that it becomes a great source of reference in the future.

Happy baking!
