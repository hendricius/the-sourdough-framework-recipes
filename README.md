# The Sourdough Framework Recipes

The Sourdough Framework Recipes is an open-source recipe book dedicated to
enabling you to bake the best possible bread at home.

## Background

4 years after launching the repositories [the-bread-code](https://github.com/hendricius/the-bread-code)
, [pizza-dough](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough)
and [the-sourdough-framework](https://github.com/hendricius/the-sourdough-framework) I
created this project to provide you with easy recipes to bake sourdough bread and yeast-based bread at home.
It is recommended to read The Sourdough
Framework first as it is the basis for the recipes in this book.
